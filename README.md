# Goated-goal
The goated goal is my attempt of creating a functional 12ft by 7ft goal for my training. I have tried to make it a bit bigger than other companies that overprice there small goals. My version of this goal is different than competitors as it has the ability to be ajusted in the range of 12 feet. That means you could change the goal size to your liking. It has two 3d printed corners that I will be getting from my highchool. All I need is to get the materials used for the bars.
## Features
- 2 strong corners that give strong support
- A big net!
- adjustable poles
- A cool name!

The 3d printed corners give the goal strong structural support needed to withstand hard shots coming at it.
